                        Chicago, on Lake Michigan in Illinois, is among the largest cities in the U.S. 
                        Famed for its bold architecture, it has a skyline punctuated by skyscrapers such as the iconic John Hancock Center, 1,451-ft. 
                        Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) and the neo-Gothic Tribune Tower. 
                        The city is also renowned for its museums, including the Art Institute of Chicago with its noted Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works.

                        Located on the shores of freshwater Lake Michigan, Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837 near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed and grew rapidly in the mid-19th century.
                        After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, which destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless, the city made a concerted effort to rebuild.
                        The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades, and by 1900 Chicago was the fifth largest city in the world.
                        Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards, including new construction styles (including the Chicago School of architecture), the development of the City Beautiful Movement, and the steel-framed skyscraper.
